# This is a sample YAML file for fault injection configuration for the RNN example.
# The meaning of labels and their allowed values are explained for your choosing.

# "Artifact" specifies the model parameter to inject.
#  - "0" - Corresponds to the LSTM kernel layer weights.
#  - "1" - Corresponds to the recurrent LSTM kernel layer weights.
#  - "2" - Corresponds to the LSTM kernel biases.
#  - "3" - Corresponds to the dense layer weights.
#  - "4" - Corresponds to the dense layer biases.
Artifact: 0

# "Type" specifies the type of fault injector to call.
#  - "shuffle" - Shuffles the artifact tensor values randomly.
#  - "mutate"  - Single bit flips in "Bit" position to selected "Amount" of tensor values.
#  - "zeros"   - Updates chosen "Amount" percentage of artifact tensor values to zeros.
Type: mutate

# "Amount" specifies the amount of injection in "Artifact".
#  - Do specify an integer value between 1 and 100.
#  - When "mutate" type is selected, "Amount" corresponds to the actual number of values.
#  - When "zeros" type is selected, "Amount" corresponds to the percentage of total values.
Amount: 1

# "Bit" specifies the bit position to be flipped when "mutate" type is selected.
#  - Default "N" corresponds to the position being chosen randomly.
#  - Can specify an integer value between 0 and 31 as "Artifact" tensor values are single precision floats.
Bit: 30
